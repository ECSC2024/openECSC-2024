I created this amazing website that does absolutely nothing (unless you're an admin :P).
It only accepts registering with a `@fakemail.olicyber.it`, luckily you can request one as well!

Note: the administrator followed a training against phishing, so it will only click on links coming from the official platform email!

Note: don't waste time on the fakemail service, it was only created for fake emails, it is not the core of the challenge.
