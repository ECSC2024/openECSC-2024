  "description": "I created this amazing website that does absolutely nothing (unless you're an admin :P).\nIt only accepts registering with a `@fakemail.olicyber.it`, luckily you can request one as well!\n\nNote: the administrator followed a training against phishing, so it will only click on links coming from the official platform email!\n\nNote: don't waste time on the fakemail service, it was only created for fake emails, it is not the core of the challenge.\n\nChallenge: [http://not-phishing.challs.external.open.ecsc2024.it:38100](http://not-phishing.challs.external.open.ecsc2024.it:38100)\n\nFakemail: [http://not-phishing-fakemail.challs.external.open.ecsc2024.it:38101](http://not-phishing-fakemail.challs.external.open.ecsc2024.it:38101)",
