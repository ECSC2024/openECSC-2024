To generate SGI IRIX 64 bit offsets (in the producer code)
configure with   --enable-dwarf-format-sgi-irix.
To configure with only 32bit offsets (aka DWARF2) configure
with --enable-dwarf-format-strict-32bit.
By default the producer now generates 32bit offsets by default
but one can turn on DWARF3 64bit offset generation at runtime by ORing
DW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64 onto the flags in the call to
dwarf_producer_init() (or dwarf_producer_init_b) [when the
address size is specified as 64 bit].
