  "description": "My operating systems professor is teaching us using xv6. At the end of the\nlecture, he pointed us to section 6.10 exercise 1 of the book, which states:\n\n> Comment out the calls to `acquire` and `release` in `kalloc`\n> (`kernel/kalloc.c:69`). This seems like it should cause problems for kernel\n> code that calls `kalloc`; what symptoms do you expect to see? When you run\n> xv6, do you see these symptoms? How about when running `usertests`? If you\n> don\u2019t see a problem, why not? See if you can provoke a problem by inserting\n> dummy loops into the critical section of `kalloc`.\n\nCan you help me write a decent answer before the next lecture?\n\n`nc xv6homework.challs.open.ecsc2024.it 38016`",
