My operating systems professor is teaching us using xv6. At the end of the
lecture, he pointed us to section 6.10 exercise 1 of the book, which states:

> Comment out the calls to `acquire` and `release` in `kalloc`
> (`kernel/kalloc.c:69`). This seems like it should cause problems for kernel
> code that calls `kalloc`; what symptoms do you expect to see? When you run
> xv6, do you see these symptoms? How about when running `usertests`? If you
> donâ€™t see a problem, why not? See if you can provoke a problem by inserting
> dummy loops into the critical section of `kalloc`.

Can you help me write a decent answer before the next lecture?
