## Solution

We are given partial source code for a common lisp application
implementing a web service. The business logic of the service is
implemented in a POST endpoint under `/interpolate`. By reading the
source code and sending POST requests to the endpoint and analyzing its
detailed error responses we understand we have to send it an
[s-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) in the
following shape:

```lisp
(:template "A template string with {interpolation} {flags}"
 :substitutions ((:interpolation . "very good")
                 (:flags . "intentions")))
```

The `:substitutions` _association list_ members will be interpolated
into the value of `:template`.

By analyzing the source code further, we can see the parsing of
s-expressions is delegated to the builtin common lisp parser function
`read`, the same being used by the language's compiler, which in common
lisp is available at runtime and can be programmatically invoked. The
common lisp parser `read` has some well known vulnerabilities when
handed with user-controlled input, such as the ability to compile and
evaluate code at read-time when it encounters the magic macro character
sequence [`#.`](http://clhs.lisp.se/Body/02_dhf.htm). This well-known
vulnerability is mitigated by binding the dynamic variable `*read-eval*`
to `nil` (false) before executing the call to `read`, disabling this
potentially harmful behavior. Common lisp's input syntax can be heavily
modified by operating on an internal data structure called the
`*readtable*` and other configuration variables; it is therefore common
to execute calls to `read` that must handle data in an external
representation in the context of the `with-standard-io-syntax` "context
manager" macro. This ensures that reasonable default are in place when
reading data coming from other systems, for example over the internet.
An often overlooked side-effect of `with-standard-io-syntax`, though, is
resetting `*read-eval*` to its default `t` (true).
`(with-standard-io-syntax ...)` and `(let ((*read-eval* nil)) ...)`
should therefore appear in this exact order for the program to be safe;
the authors of the Interpolator have flipped them by mistake, rendering
the service vulnerable to read-time evaluation attacks. We test out
guess by writing and testing an attack payload:

```lisp
(:template "{test}"
 :substitutions ((:test . #.(concatenate 'string "Hello " "world!"))))
```

The server answers with `Hello world!`, and the service is vulnerable.

We try to extract the value of the `*flag*` global variable that we see
redacted in the provided source, and we learn we have to prefix it with
an explicit package specifier because the read-eval expression is not
being evaluated in the context of the same package as the source code
(`:app.web`). The `*flag*` symbol is not publically exported, but common
lisp allows us to access it anyways by doubling the colon between the
package and symbol names:

```lisp
(:template "{flag}"
 :substitutions ((:flag . #.app.web::*flag*)))
```

By writing the payload this way, it is as if we had sent the flag itself
in the body of the POST request to the `/interpolate` endpoint,
therefore the flag value undergoes the same safety checks that regular
user input is subject to. One of the validation rules prohibits curly
brace characters `{` and `}` in substitution texts to avoid multiple
(possibly recursive) interpolations, but the flag format containts those
characters. To allow the flag to pass all validity checks for
interpolation into `:template`, we can transform it using standard
common lisp functions in various ways, for example substituting the
prohibited characters for other acceptable ones, or by encoding the
whole string in a different representation, such as a base16 string as
demonstrated in the following example:

```lisp
(:template "{hexflag}"
 :substitutions ((:hexflag . #.(format nil "窿磲ъ轶灬礅溽ㄣ黩轸瀛麸篝蜷铉ㄣ栳颦泔溴悌衡狍倍┅狃甬麇夂邯骒徵┅┅噜澡孱泔溴骒徵轶篚沣弩箧蹯禊轭翦蝠镬狒邃轭麸翳翦眇灬翦篝蜷铉犷蝈骒邈翦麸躞轭翳箦蝣弪蝈箴镱箦族汜铒溴泔溴翳骒徵躞轭瘗翳镱矧雉桢篝犷溽蜾麸镬螽
