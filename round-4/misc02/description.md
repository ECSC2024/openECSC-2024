Someone run `chmod 772` on the flag.

I had `1kat` installed, but it can read only the first kB of a file, can you read the flag?

Note: this is not a kernel challenge, the relevant part of the setup is in the file `source/rcS` between the `CHALLENGE` comments.

`nc chmod772.challs.open.ecsc2024.it 47002`
